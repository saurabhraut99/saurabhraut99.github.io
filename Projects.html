                    <h4><b>Penn Search - Distributed Search Engine</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Built a completely distributed search engine consisting of Web Crawler, Indexer, Page Ranker, & an interactive UI</li>
                        <li>Crawled more than 1 million web pages using StormLite, a lightweight version of Apache Storm, running on EC2
                            instances. SQS was used as a crawl frontier and the crawled pages were stored in a S3 bucket</li>
                        <li>Indexed and ranked the crawled pages as Hadoop MapReduce tasks and handled search queries from user using
                            self-built version of Apache Spark</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><b>Penn Cloud</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Built a cloud platform that supports web-mail service and storage service analogous to Gmail and Google Drive</li>
                        <li>Storage was based on distributed key-value store (similar to Bigtable) and factors like load balancing, fault
                            tolerance, replication, consistency were taken into consideration as well</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><b>Chat Server</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Built a replicated chat server that uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to multicast chat messages</li>
                        <li>The server supports three different ordering modes: unordered, FIFO, and total ordered multicast</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><b>Emotion Analysis of Movie Characters</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Performed scene wise emotion analysis of movie characters based on their dialogues in the script</li>
                        <li>Trained and tested a few linear and non-linear models and found that a simple MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
                            model with BERT embeddings generated best results</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><b>Content Labelling of Hidden Services</b></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classified the darknet data into topics using two different approaches - Topic Modelling and Graph of Words</li>
                        <li>Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper that was published in Dark Web Pattern Recognition and Crime Analysis Using
                            Machine Intelligence - IGI Global</li>
                    </ul>
